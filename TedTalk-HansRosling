# Ted Talk by Hans Rosling - The Best Stats You've Ever Seen

Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?

One in each pair has twice the mortality rate than the other
•	This makes it so that the difference is bigger than the uncertainty of the data

The reason the Swedish students got it wrong was not ignorance but because of preconceived ideas

Data from 1962
Western World
o	Small families and long lives
Third World
o	Large families and short lives
•	Over time and in through the 90’s the AIDS epidemic shortens the life expectancy of African populations
•	New World
o	Long lives and small families
•	USA vs. Vietnam in 1964
o	USA had small families and long life
o	Vietnam had large families and short life
	Even with all the death during the war there was an improvement of life expectancy
	Family planning started in Vietnam in end of 1979
•	They went for smaller families
	1979
•	USA is getting longer life, keeping family size
	Today in Vietnam we have the same life expectancy and the same family size
o	There was social change before any economic change in Asia
•	World distribution of income of people
o	There’s no gap between rich and poor people anymore
o	The richest 20% take out of the world’s annual income about 74%
o	The poorest 20% take out of the world’s annual income about 2%
	This shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful
o	Africa (10% of world population) and most in poverty
o	The OECD (the country club of the UN – very rich) 
	There is quite an overlap between Africa and OECD in annual income
o	Latin America has everything on this earth, from the poorest to the richest
	On top of that we can put East Europe, East Asia, and South Asia
o	In 1970, most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians
	And now, while population increased, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty and some others get into poverty
•	Our concept of economy is growth with percent
o	Possibility of percentile increase
•	The linearity is very strong between child survival and money
•	The differences are much bigger than the weaknesses of the data
•	It’s dangerous to use average data because there is a lot of difference within countries
o	Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960
	If you split Uganda, there’s quite a difference within Uganda
o	The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized
	It’s not relevant to have it on a regional level
•	Almost no overlap in income distributions of China and the US in 1970
o	But moving forward, China is growing, it’s not so equal any longer and its overlooking the United States
